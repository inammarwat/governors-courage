# Governors-Courage

*Overview
This project investigates the relationship between electoral outcomes and candidate longevity using U.S. gubernatorial election data. It explores predictive modeling for life insurance applications and causal inference for political science research, using close-election regression analysis.

The analysis is built in R using the tidymodels, tidyverse, and gt packages. It involves filtering, exploratory analysis, linear regression modeling, and interpretation of confidence intervals.

*Objectives
We explore two core scenarios:

*Predictive:
Forecast how long a gubernatorial winner is likely to live after election using available demographic and election variables.

*Causal:
Estimate the causal effect of winning an election on a candidateâ€™s post-election lifespan, leveraging close-election regression as a quasi-experiment.
